# IoTgo

IoTgo or the Game of Internet of Things is a tangible board game to help end-users with no experience of creating interactive IoT-enabled smart things.



IoTgo has been used by various international artists from Italy, Spain, Greece, Pakistan and Bangladesh to create interactive artworks.
